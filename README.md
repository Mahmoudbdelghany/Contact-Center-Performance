# Contact-Center-Performance Analysis
# ðŸ”§ Project Steps: 
**1-Data Consolidation:**

Integrated data from multiple sources including call logs, CRM, and customer feedback.

**2-KPI Definition:**

Aligned metrics with business goals â€“ SLA %, PCA %, AHT, FCR, and CSAT.

**3-Dashboard Design:** 

Built user-friendly dashboards using filters for quarter, month, day, skill, and language.

**4-Segmentation:** 

Visualized data by day, month, language, and skill to uncover performance trends.


**5-Actionable Insights:** 

Enabled the operations team to quickly identify bottlenecks and take corrective actions. 

# ðŸ“ˆ Key Results:
**SLA % achieved: 81.72%**

**PCA % (Perfect Call Adherence): 93.24%**

**AHT (Average Handling Time): 437.04 sec**

**CSAT Score: 4.63 / 5**

**FCR (First Call Resolution): 0.93**

# ðŸ“Š Key Insights from the Report
**1-SLA (Service Level Achievement):**

Current SLA is 81.72%, indicating room for improvement in meeting response targets.

**2-PCA (Perfect Call Adherence):**

High PCA at 93.24%, showing agents are mostly following call scripts and protocols.

**3-AHT (Average Handling Time):**

AHT is 437.04 seconds, which is relatively high and could impact SLA and customer satisfaction.

**4-AHT Trends**

**By Month:**

AHT decreased from October to January, a sign of improving efficiency.

**By Language:**

Arabic (AR) and English (ENG) calls have similar AHT, with Arabic slightly higher.

**By Quarter and Language:**

Slight fluctuation across quarters; Q4 Arabic calls have the highest AHT.

**5-Skill Performance**

**SLA by Skill:**

Both Inquiry and Complain skills have similar SLA levels (around 75â€“80%).

***Answered Calls by Skill:**

Inquiry and Complain calls are nearly evenly distributed in terms of response rate.

**6. CSAT vs. FCR by Month**

Visual correlation shows that months with higher FCR often align with higher CSAT, reinforcing the importance of solving issues on the first call.

# ðŸ“Œ Recommendations

**investigate causes for high AHT, especially in Q4 Arabic interactions.**

**Focus on boosting SLA by reducing waiting/handling time and balancing workforce allocation.**

**Continue efforts in maintaining high PCA and FCR, as theyâ€™re strongly linked to CSAT.**

**Prepare for high-volume months like Januaryâ€“March with better forecasting and staffing.**
